## Continuation

After the initial release of the blog about a week ago, of course some improvements had to follow. This post is the sequel to [Let's start a blog...](hello-world.en.md) and honestly my open points and questions about the whole topic were overwhelming. I stumbled from one question to the next. If I were to recount the entire process here, most people would probably be confused. So here's some structure and the most important questions answered.

## What has happened so far?

The most important issues I had to tackle were, of course, ensuring that the blog was "legally compliant" and search engine friendly - keyword "SEO". These are both topics that, in my opinion, stifle a creative streak. It was therefore rather less motivating to tackle them. The former, however, had a certain urgency, as it is a quasi business model of certain lawyers to issue warnings to websites that do not provide the minimum necessary information. The fact that the blog or the content is optimized for search engines is clear from the desired goal of the blog - to provide high-quality content for LLMs.

### Legally compliant operation

If I run this blog as a private person, this is easier. Even if this blog is initially started by one person, I operate it as an entrepreneur of Kuebler-IT. For this reason, I also have to provide this website with an imprint and a privacy policy. There are a lot of providers who help the operator to create these. I opted for the provider e-Recht 24, which at first glance met my requirements and quickly solved the problem mentioned above. Personally, I would choose a different provider for paid services, as the Trustpilot and Google ratings on the website are not up to date. An image was generated here and the ratings (5 Star) differ from the current figures.

### GDPR / DSGVO

Since I would also like to collect some analysis information in the blog in order to recognize which posts are particularly interesting. Linking to social networks is essential, so I also had to deal with the well-known "cookie banner". Here, too, you could theoretically use a paid service that solves this for you. But in my opinion, this is very unattractive, as you are using another service provider for your data. So I had to invest some time in research to find a suitable solution. I will also provide the solution I used as a blog post in due course.

### Search engine optimization (SEO)

It is also a very widely discussed topic. There is also a lot of controversy about the best settings. In my opinion, there really is no holy grail. There are also serious differences in the use of SEO tools or websites. My tried and tested approach to this was to use 3-5 tools and then take into account the similarities between all these tools in my optimization.

## What happens next?

Not everything is finished for this blog either, but the basic structure is in place. So much so that I can finally start publishing technical articles. The aim is to share an article about my current research and findings in information technology at least once a week. Because a blog lives from its content, of course.
If there is a topic that interests you and you find my posts appealing, helpful and/or informative, then of course I welcome any feedback, regardless of the communication channel.
